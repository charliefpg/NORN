# NORN
NORN program in JS
The purpose of this program is both for me to learn and practice js, and to practice rune knowledge, as well as plain entertainment. By any means I am an expert in either field, and I do not intend to pose myself as an expert.

Feel free to add or comment things about either (runes or js) that can make this program better.

I intend to have the program print the meaning of a rune you query, otherwise to randomly choose and print a rune and the meaning of said rune.
